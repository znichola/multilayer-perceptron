# multilayer-perceptron

An introduction to artificial neural networks through the implementation of a
multilayer perceptron.

## Notions for the evaluation

Must understand the training phase (learning pase) and the underlying
algorythms.

- feedforward
- backprogagation
- gradient decent

## Dataset

It's a csv file with 32 columns extracted from a real dataset of cell
characteristics based on fine-needle aspiration, more info
[WDBC](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.names).

The goal is to predic a cancer diagnosis, the M,B colum in the dataset
(malignant or benign). The data needs proprocessing before being used.
